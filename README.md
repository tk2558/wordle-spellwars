# Wordle-SpellWars

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The purpose of this project was to create a game based on the mechanics of Wordle with a theme of Wizards casting spells.

## Gameplay

Players choose a type of Elemental Wizard to play as and solve Wordle puzzles to cast spells.\
Each Wizard has different effect upon casting spells.

In PvP mode: 2 Players will continously cast spells to damage each other until one Player hits 0 hp\
Failing to cast a spell by either not figuring out the right word or running out time will cause the spell to fizzle.
When a spell fizzles it, the spellcaster will take recoil damage

### `npm start`
